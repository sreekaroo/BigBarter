# BigBarter

A Dapp built during HackMIT for the Solana Challenge. Won 1st place for Solana Challenge.

## Project Idea description :

The goal of Big Barter is to provide a familiar community driven environment for the safe exchanging of goods and potentially services. By storing barter data on a decentralized network, there is no fear of the transaction data being consumed by some tech giant like Facebook marketplace. To facilitate this, we deployed a Smart Contract on the Solana Devnet ledger to allow our custom data to live on the blockchain. In addition, users can only barter within communities they choose, adding familiarity among exchanges. And most importantly, users know that the data is verified and they arenâ€™t being scammed - the item is linked to an NFT in the blockchain and each transaction is confirmed to be valid.

### Technical Jargon that we accomplished -- 

we deployed 2 Accounts to devnet, 1 program account for transactions, and 1 data account to store user registration on chain. Link to Solana Playground for the accounts we created. https://beta.solpg.io/63399ac077ea7f12846aeead
